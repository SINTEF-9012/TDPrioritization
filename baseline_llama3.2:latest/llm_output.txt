"Based on the provided documents, I have analyzed the code and identified three long methods that could be improved. Here are the results of the prioritization:

1. `test_anyof_schema` with 50 lines:
	* Contextual relevance: High
	* Description: This test case tests the functionality of the `anyof` schema in the Cerberus validation library.
	* Smell score: 8/10 (long method, but its purpose is clear and relevant to the library's functionality)
2. `test_bad_schema` with 50 lines:
	* Contextual relevance: Medium
	* Description: This test case tests the error handling when a schema is invalid or incomplete.
	* Smell score: 7/10 (long method, but its purpose is somewhat unclear and could be improved)
3. `test_anyof_schema` with 50 lines:
	* Contextual relevance: High
	* Description: This test case seems to be a duplicate of the previous one.
	* Smell score: 9/10 ( identical code, which is not recommended)

Ranked list:

1. `test_bad_schema` (score: 7/10)
2. `test_anyof_schema` (score: 8/10) (note: the second instance of this test case has a slightly lower score due to its duplication)
3. `test_anyof_schema` (score: 9/10)

Recommendation:
The most important smell to resolve is the duplicate test case (`test_anyof_schema`) with the highest score, which should be refactored to remove the redundant code.

For the second instance of `test_anyof_schema`, consider refactoring it to make its purpose more clear or removing it altogether if it's not essential to the library's functionality.

The third instance of `test_anyof_schema` is a clear duplicate and can be removed entirely."
