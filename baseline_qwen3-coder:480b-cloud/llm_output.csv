Rank|Name of Smell|Name|File|Reason for Prioritization
1|High Cyclomatic Complexity|'train_with_cross_validation'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/td_trainer.py|Highest cyclomatic complexity (19); increases defect risk and is difficult to test; located in core training logic.
2|High Cyclomatic Complexity|'train'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/base.py|High cyclomatic complexity (13); part of base training flow, affects multiple downstream processes.
3|Long Method|'main'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/inference.py|Very long method (127 lines); central to inference workflow; high risk of logic errors and difficult to maintain.
4|Long Method|'compute_metrics'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/metrics.py|Extremely long method (118 lines); handles critical evaluation logic; high complexity and visualization coupling.
5|Long Method|'fine_tune_model'|../projects/text_classification/app.py|Long method (77 lines); tightly coupled with OS and data operations; violates SRP and hard to test.
6|Long Method|'main'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/train.py|Long method (86 lines); core training entry point; complex argument handling and model setup.
7|Long Method|'generate_model_card'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/upload_to_hf.py|Long method (67 lines); handles model card generation with many I/O and formatting operations.
8|Long Method|'main'|../projects/text_classification/hf_upload_example.py|Moderate-length method (50 lines); example script but still impacts usability and clarity.
9|Long Method|'split_data'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/data/data_splitter.py|Long method (73 lines); data preparation logic; affects data quality and downstream model performance.
10|High Cyclomatic Complexity|'predict_from_file'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/inference.py|High cyclomatic complexity (11); shared between two inference engines; affects prediction reliability.
11|High Cyclomatic Complexity|'predict_from_file'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/inference.py|High cyclomatic complexity (11); duplicate of previous smell in different file; same risk profile.
12|Long File|tdsuite.trainers.td_trainer|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/td_trainer.py|Large file (294 lines) with high churn (576) and low commit frequency; contains many training-related functions that are reused across the project.
