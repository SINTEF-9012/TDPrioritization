Rank|Name of Smell|Name|File|Reason for Prioritization
1|Long Method|'main'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/inference.py|Highest complexity and critical functionality (inference engine); high defect association and difficult to test; used across multiple modules.
2|Long Method|'main'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/train.py|Core training logic with high complexity; contains model initialization, data processing, and training orchestration; difficult to maintain.
3|Long Method|'compute_metrics'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/metrics.py|Critical for evaluation and reporting; complex logic for metric computation and visualization; affects accuracy assessment.
4|Long Method|'fine_tune_model'|../projects/text_classification/app.py|High churn (380 lines) and complex fine-tuning workflow; impacts model performance directly; tightly coupled with UI components.
5|Long Method|'split_data'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/data/data_splitter.py|Data preprocessing logic with class balancing and repository filtering; affects data quality and model training inputs.
6|Long Method|'generate_model_card'|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/upload_to_hf.py|Generates model documentation; impacts usability and reproducibility; moderate complexity but important for deployment.
7|Long Method|'main'|../projects/text_classification/hf_upload_example.py|Example script with user interaction and subprocess execution; low reuse but potential security and error handling issues.
8|Long File|tdsuite.trainers.td_trainer|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/td_trainer.py|Large file (294 lines) with high churn (576) and low commit frequency; contains many training‑related functions that are reused across the project.
