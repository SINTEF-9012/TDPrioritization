"<Rank>, <Name of smell>, <Type of smell>, <File name>, <Reason for prioritization>

1, compute_metrics, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/metrics.py, Highest complexity (28) and multiple refactor issues (too-many-locals, too-many-branches, too-many-statements) indicating severe maintainability issues. Critical metrics computation function that affects model evaluation reliability.

2, main, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/inference.py, Very high complexity (23) with 127 lines and multiple refactor issues (too-many-locals, too-many-branches, too-many-statements). Core inference function that directly impacts production usage and has broad exception handling issues.

3, TDTrainer.train_with_cross_validation, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/td_trainer.py, High complexity (24) with significant refactor issues and is part of a long file (294 lines). Core training functionality with multiple responsibilities and error handling issues.

4, split_data, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/data/data_splitter.py, High complexity (14) with 73 lines and multiple refactor issues (too-many-arguments, too-many-locals, too-many-branches). Critical data processing function with complex logic that affects data quality.

5, fine_tune_model, Code, ../projects/text_classification/app.py, High complexity (7) with 77 lines and multiple serious issues including import errors, variable usage before assignment, and unexpected keyword arguments. Core application functionality with runtime error risks.

6, main, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/train.py, Medium-high complexity (4) with 86 lines. Contains unexpected keyword argument errors and encoding issues. Core training entry point with potential runtime failures.

7, generate_model_card, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/upload_to_hf.py, Medium complexity (4) with 67 lines and too-many-statements issue. Important for model documentation but less critical than core functionality.

8, main, Code, ../projects/text_classification/hf_upload_example.py, Lowest complexity (11) with 50 lines. Simple example function with only trailing whitespace issues. Least critical as it's example code."
