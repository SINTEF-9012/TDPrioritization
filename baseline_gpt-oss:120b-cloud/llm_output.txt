"1, **Long Method – compute_metrics**, Code, `../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/metrics.py`, **Core utility that calculates all classification scores and writes files/plots; errors here directly corrupt evaluation results and downstream model decisions, making defect risk very high.**  
2, **Long Method – main (inference script)**, Code, `../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/inference.py`, **Handles the production inference flow, emissions tracking, ensemble logic, and metric saving; a failure propagates to end‑users and can hide costly bugs, so it warrants top priority.**  
3, **Long Method – main (training script)**, Code, `../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/train.py`, **Orchestrates GPU checks, data loading, model creation, trainer configuration and model persistence; any mistake breaks the whole training pipeline, a high‑impact component.**  
4, **Long Method – split_data**, Code, `../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/data/data_splitter.py`, **Data‑splitting and label‑mapping logic is applied to every experiment; subtle bugs produce mislabeled data that affect every model, so it is a high‑priority maintainability and defect risk area.**  
5, **Long Method – fine_tune_model**, Code, `../projects/text_classification/app.py`, **Combines dataset loading, tokenisation, training, evaluation and report generation; errors affect model performance reporting and can mislead stakeholders.**  
6, **Long Method – generate_model_card**, Code, `../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/upload_to_hf.py`, **Produces the model card that is published to Hugging Face; while not affecting model correctness, incorrect metadata harms reproducibility and user trust.**  
7, **Long File – TDTrainer**, Structural, `../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/td_trainer.py`, **A 294‑line class file is hard to navigate and refactor; its size hurts maintainability and future extension, but its impact is less immediate than the runtime‑critical functions above.**  
8, **Long Method – main (HF upload example)**, Code, `../projects/text_classification/hf_upload_example.py`, **An example script used primarily for demos; defects here have low production impact, making it the lowest priority among the eight smells.**"
