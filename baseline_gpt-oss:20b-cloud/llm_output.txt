"1, Long File, Structural, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/td_trainer.py, **High impact & medium severity** – the trainer is a core, frequently‑used component. The file exceeds 280 lines and already carries a medium severity rating; a refactor here will reduce the risk of bugs, simplify future updates, and improve overall maintainability.

2, Long Method `main` (inference), Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/inference.py, **Critical user‑facing path** – the inference entry point is executed by end users and may be invoked in production. A 127‑line method increases the likelihood of faults, slows down debugging, and poses a risk to performance and reproducibility. Early refactoring will strengthen the reliability of the inference service.

3, Long Method `main` (train), Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/train.py, **Core training pipeline** – similar to inference, the training pipeline is central to the project’s function. The 86‑line main method encapsulates a large amount of logic; breaking it into smaller, testable pieces will improve the maintainability of training schedules and hyper‑parameter sweeps.

4, Long Method `compute_metrics`, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/metrics.py, **Widely‑used evaluation logic** – this method is invoked by multiple components (training, inference, post‑processing). Its extreme length makes it very error‑prone, difficult to unit‑test, and hard to extend. Refactoring will reduce the surface area for regression bugs and improve test coverage.

5, Long Method `split_data`, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/data/data_splitter.py, **Data preparation is critical, but less frequently called** – the split is performed once per experiment, yet the 73‑line method bundles many responsibilities (format handling, label mapping, stratified sampling). Splitting this into focused utility functions will help reuse code across projects without immediate urgency.

6, Long Method `generate_model_card`, Code, ../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/upload_to_hf.py, **Convenience feature** – generates a Hugging Face model card. While useful, it’s an auxiliary, rarely‑executed helper. It can be refactored later without affecting core functionality.

7, Long Method `fine_tune_model`, Code, ../projects/text_classification/app.py, **Single‑use tuning routine** – the method is sizeable and only used in one place. It’s a lower‑priority issue relative to core training/inference, but refactoring will make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

8, Long Method `main` (hf_upload_example), Code, ../projects/text_classification/hf_upload_example.py, **Small example script** – this 50‑line script is meant for demonstration and is not part of the production pipeline. It is the least critical, so it can be addressed last."
