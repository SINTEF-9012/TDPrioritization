"Rank|Name of Smell|Name|File|Reason for Prioritization
1|Long File|tdsuite.trainers.td_trainer|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/trainers/td_trainer.py|Large file (294 lines) with high churn (576) and multiple responsibilities; core training logic, high propagation risk and long‑term maintenance cost.
2|Long Method|main|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/inference.py|Main inference routine (127 lines) with high churn (474) and frequent use in production; complexity hampers testing and increases defect risk.
3|Long Method|main|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/train.py|Primary training script (86 lines) with significant churn (387); critical for model development, high impact on overall pipeline.
4|Long Method|compute_metrics|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/utils/metrics.py|Metrics calculation used by both training and inference (118 lines, churn 412); errors here propagate to all evaluation results, high defect potential.
5|Long Method|fine_tune_model|../projects/text_classification/app.py|Fine‑tuning helper (77 lines, churn 380); important for end‑user workflows but less central than core training/inference logic.
6|Long Method|split_data|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/data/data_splitter.py|Data‑splitting utility (73 lines, churn 417); essential for reproducibility but can be refactored with lower immediate risk.
7|Long Method|generate_model_card|../projects/text_classification/tdsuite/upload_to_hf.py|Model‑card generation (67 lines, churn 201); documentation helper, lower impact on runtime correctness.
8|Long Method|main|../projects/text_classification/hf_upload_example.py|Example script (50 lines, churn 84); low usage, minimal effect on core quality, lowest priority."
