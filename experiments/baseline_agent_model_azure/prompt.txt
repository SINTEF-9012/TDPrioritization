ai_code_segment_summary:
The 144-line calculate_change_proneness function exemplifies a Long Method smell by cramming repository access, diff parsing, multiple metric calculations, error handling, and summary statistics into one monolithic block. Such sprawling logic reduces readability and makes it difficult for developers to understand or isolate individual behaviors. This complexity also hinders targeted testing of specific calculations and increases the risk of introducing defects when modifying any part of the function.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The calculate_change_frequency function stretches across nearly 100 lines and blends branch resolution, commit iteration, diff parsing, statistical aggregation, and DataFrame construction into one monolithic block. Its length and nested logic hinder readability and make it difficult to isolate and test individual behaviors, increasing the risk of defects and slowing down maintenance. Continuous modifications to this sprawling method are likely to introduce subtle bugs and hamper reliable testing efforts.

ai_code_segment_summary:
This module spans over 350 lines and bundles three complex metric calculators into a single file, making it difficult to navigate and understand at a glance. Its sheer size increases cognitive load, obscures the individual responsibilities of each function, and complicates writing focused tests. As a result, maintainability suffers and the risk of defects and regressions rises when modifying or extending any part of its logic.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The calculate_co_change_matrix function stretches over 60 lines and intertwines branch fallback logic, commit traversal, file and co-change counting, matrix construction, and metadata aggregation all in one place. This long method increases cognitive load, makes isolating and testing individual steps difficult, and raises the chance of bugs slipping through due to its nested loops and exception handling. As a result, maintainers face greater effort in understanding and safely modifying the code, heightening defect risk and impairing overall maintainability.

The get_logger function exhibits Feature Envy by making multiple calls into the external logging API rather than operating on its own data, indicating it is overly concerned with the internals of the logging subsystem. This heavy reliance on logging’s implementation details increases coupling, making the function harder to maintain and adapt if the logging behavior or API changes. It also complicates testing because the method manipulates global logger state and handlers, raising the risk of hidden side effects and defects.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The main function heavily depends on the parsed arguments object, calling its attributes repeatedly rather than encapsulating related behavior elsewhere, which illustrates the Feature Envy smell by showing that most of its logic is tied to the structure of `args`. This concentration of argument handling in one place makes the entry point bloated and tightly coupled to the CLI interface. As a result, maintainability suffers because any change to the arguments or their use requires modifying this sprawling method, testability is hampered by the lack of smaller, isolated units, and the risk of defects rises as error paths and argument-dependent logic accumulate in a single block.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The calculate_change_frequency function stretches across nearly 100 lines and blends branch resolution, commit iteration, diff parsing, statistical aggregation, and DataFrame construction into one monolithic block. Its length and nested logic hinder readability and make it difficult to isolate and test individual behaviors, increasing the risk of defects and slowing down maintenance. Continuous modifications to this sprawling method are likely to introduce subtle bugs and hamper reliable testing efforts.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The get_changed_files function lives in a module focused on co-change metrics but spends nearly all of its logic calling into the Commit and diff API rather than operating on its own data, which is a classic case of feature envy. By coupling so heavily to the gitpython implementation details, the method becomes harder to understand and maintain, and writing isolated unit tests against it is cumbersome. This tight coupling also raises the risk of defects whenever the external API evolves or edge cases in diff handling emerge.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The calculate_co_change_metrics function spans nearly 70 lines, combining data loading, multiple nested loops for coupling calculations, sorting logic, and result assembly in one block. Its length and mixed responsibilities increase cognitive load and make unit testing individual parts difficult, raising the risk of undetected defects. Maintenance becomes harder as future developers struggle to navigate and extend the sprawling logic, and any change in one section could inadvertently break calculations elsewhere.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The get_lines_of_code method contains an excessive number of conditional branches, nested try/except blocks, and loops to handle error recovery, file traversal, extension checks, and comment detection, driving its cyclomatic complexity up to 15. This level of complexity makes the method hard to read and understand, increases the effort required to write thorough unit tests for all execution paths, and raises the likelihood of defects slipping through when evolving or debugging the code.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The parse_args function spends all its logic invoking methods on the argparse.Parser object instead of encapsulating any behavior of its own, which is a classic case of feature envy. This heavy reliance on the parser’s API makes the code more tightly coupled to argparse details, reducing readability and making future changes riskier. It also complicates unit testing because nearly every behavior depends on the external parser interface rather than on simpler, testable logic.

ai_code_segment_summary:
The calculate_error_proneness function’s 134 lines pack in commit retrieval, regex compilation, diff processing, file content extraction, metric calculations, and summary aggregation into a single block, making it hard to follow and reason about. Its length and mixed responsibilities increase the risk of undetected bugs, complicate writing focused unit tests, and slow down maintenance or updates. As a result, teams are likely to face higher cognitive load when diagnosing issues or extending functionality, raising the defect and technical debt burden.
